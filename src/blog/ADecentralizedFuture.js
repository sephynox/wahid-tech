            The internet is arguably the most important innovation in our modern times.
            I remember the internet's "Netscape moment" though I was only a child at the time.
            As an engineer and technologist, I would have been ecstatic to live through the
            Netscape moment with what I know today. However, as we know--at least,
            for now--we cannot go back in time. Although, history has an interesting
            habit of rhyming and we may very well be experiencing the next technological
            breakthrough of our time.

            What many forget is that the internet was met with a surprising amount
            of skepticism and at one point considered a "passing fad" by newspaper outlets
            like the Daily Mail. However, like others throughout history that felt threatened
            by innovative technologies, the Daily Mail made statements that today would be
            considered absurd. One may even argue that today's experts may be tomorrow's fools
            and to support that point, we can take a look back in history.
        </p>
        <h3>Yesterday's Experts</h3>
        <p>
            We will start with something more familiar as the further back in time we go,
            the more ridiculous the statements begin to sound. Thus, the first stop we will
            arrive at is the original iPhone. Some of us may be aware of Steve Balmer's now
            famous criticisms of the device in which he stated "I said that is the most
            expensive phone in the world and it doesn't appeal to business customers
            because it doesn't have a keyboard which makes it not a very good email
            machine." Although that was not the only criticism as others like Matthew Lynn
            declared that the "iPhone is nothing more than a luxury bauble that will appeal to a
            few gadget freaks" or "John Dvorak's predication that there was "no likelihood" Apple
            could succeed in the phone business" (Weissmann, 2012). Today, the iPhone is arguably
            the most successful electronic device ever conceived.

            While a keyboard-less smartphone may be more understandable in recent times, one
            that I always like to fall back on was the original skepticism that the first
            automobiles faced in America. Alexander Winton, a pioneer of the automotive industry
            was once told that "You're crazy if you think this fool contraption you’ve been
            wasting your time on will ever displace the horse." However, what
            was most amazing was that the horseless carriage was "such an amazing production
            that no one believed it" (Winton, 2017). It was this disbelief and utter lack of
            imagination to the possibilities for the technology that left so-called experts
            making statements which never aged well. Although, true futurists such as Thomas
            Edison saw the potential stating "Talking of horseless carriage suggests to my
            mind that the horse is doomed. The bicycle, which, 10 years ago, was a curiosity,
            is now a necessity. It is found everywhere. Ten years from now you will be able to
            buy a horseless vehicle for what you would pay today for a wagon and a pair
            of horses. The money spent in the keep of the horses will be saved and the danger
            to life will be much reduced." (Winton, 2017).
        </p>
        <p>
            Which brings us to our final stop in history: the printing press. The printing press
            is arguably the most important technological innovation in human history. It was here
            that information society was born and took its first steps toward the decentralization
            of information starting with the authority built up around the Roman Catholic Church.
            The printing press was a splash that caused ripples throughout society leading to
            entirely new fields of study that could be written down and shared in a fungible
            manner. Despite this, the experts of the day had a different and exceedingly laughable
            interpretation at the time. One example is Johannes Trithemius, a well-known German
            scribe known for writing the book "Steganographia," a book on steganography written
            in 1499 who wrote “Printed books will never equal scribed books, especially because
            the spelling and ornamentation of some printed books is often neglected.”
            (Chenoweth, 2019). Such a statement today would be utterly absurd and history is
            littered with these examples.
        </p>
        <h3>The Issues of Trust</h3>
        <p>
            Over five-hundred years ago, Fra Luca Bartolomeo de Pacioli published the famous
            book, "Summa de arithmetica" with the help of the printing press. This book was
            known for describing the principles of double-entry bookkeeping--principles which
            are largely unchanged to this day. This earned Pacioli the moniker of "The Father
            of Accounting and Bookkeeping." Unfortunately, a problem with this system was
            that it required trust in the bookkeeper. Even in modern times, this failure of
            trust has been felt in examples such as Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, Freddie Mac, AIG,
            Lehman Brothers, Bernie Madoff, and many others. Yet, instances of fraud can be
            seen throughout all of history with the first record of fraud occurring in
            300 B.C. when a Greek merchant attempted to commit insurance fraud but instead
            drowned when he was caught in the act (Beattie, 2019).

        <h3>Decentralized Ledger Technology</h3>
        <h3>Tomorrow's Fools</h3>
        <p>
            Thus, we come to the so-called experts of today and their very loud criticisms toward
            distributed ledger technology (DLT) and cryptocurrencies.
