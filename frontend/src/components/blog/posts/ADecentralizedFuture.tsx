            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>
                The internet is arguably one of the most important innovations in our modern times. I remember the
                internet&apos;s &ldquo;Netscape moment&rdquo; though I was only a child at the time. As an engineer and
                technologist, I would have been ecstatic to live through the Netscape moment with what I know today.
                However, as we know&mdash;at least, for now&mdash;we cannot go back in time. Although, history has an
                interesting habit of rhyming and we may very well be experiencing the next technological breakthrough
                of our time which can once again redefine the way we interact in our societies.

                What many do not realize today is that the internet was met with a surprising amount of skepticism and
                at one point considered a &ldquo;passing fad&rdquo; by newspaper outlets like the Daily Mail. Quite
                frankly, it is easy to forget such things&mdash;when was the last time you questioned the importance
                of electricity? However, not unlike others throughout history who felt threatened by innovative
                technologies, the Daily Mail made statements that today would be considered absurd. One may even
                argue that today&apos;s experts may be tomorrow&apos;s fools and to support that point, we need
                only to look back in history.

            <h4>Yesterday&apos;s Experts</h4>
            <Quote
                quote="iPhone is nothing more than a luxury bauble that will appeal to a few gadget freaks."
                author="Matthew Lynn"
            />
            <p>
                We will start with something more familiar as the further back in time we go, the more ridiculous the
                statements begin to sound. Thus, the first stop we will arrive at is the original iPhone. Some of us may
                be aware of Steve Balmer&apos;s now famous criticisms of the device for which he stated &ldquo;I said that
                is the most expensive phone in the world and it doesn&apos;t appeal to business customers because it
                doesn&apos;t have a keyboard which makes it not a very good email machine.&rdquo; Although that was not
                the only criticism as others like Matthew Lynn declared that the &ldquo;iPhone is nothing more than a
                luxury bauble that will appeal to a few gadget freaks&rdquo; or &ldquo;John Dvorak&apos;s predication
                that there was &ldquo;no likelihood&rdquo; Apple could succeed in the phone business&rdquo; (Weissmann,
                2012). Today, the iPhone is arguably the most successful electronic device ever conceived.
            </p>
            <p>
                While a keyboard-less smartphone may be more understandable in recent times, one example that I always
                like to fall back on was the original skepticism that the first automobiles faced in America. Alexander
                Winton, a pioneer of the automotive industry was once told that &ldquo;You&apos;re crazy if you think
                this fool contraption you’ve been wasting your time on will ever displace the horse.&rdquo; However,
                what was most amazing was that the horseless carriage was &ldquo;such an amazing production that no one
                believed it&rdquo; (Winton, 2017). It was this disbelief and utter lack of imagination to the possibilities
                for the technology that left so-called experts making statements which never aged well. Although, true
                futurists such as Thomas Edison saw the potential stating &ldquo;Talking of horseless carriage suggests
                to my mind that the horse is doomed. The bicycle, which, 10 years ago, was a curiosity, is now a
                necessity. It is found everywhere. Ten years from now you will be able to buy a horseless vehicle for
                what you would pay today for a wagon and a pair of horses. The money spent in the keep of the horses
                will be saved and the danger to life will be much reduced.&rdquo; (Winton, 2017).
            </p>
            <p>
                Which brings us to our final stop in history: the printing press. The printing press is arguably the
                most important technological innovation in human history. It was here that information society took its
                first steps toward the decentralization of information starting with the authority built up around the
                Roman Catholic Church. The printing press was a splash that caused ripples throughout society leading to
                entirely new fields of study that could be written down and shared in a fungible manner. Despite this,
                the experts of the day had a different and exceedingly laughable interpretation at the time. One example
                is Johannes Trithemius, a well-known German scribe known for writing the book &ldquo;Steganographia,&rdquo;
                a book on steganography written in 1499 who wrote &ldquo;Printed books will never equal scribed books,
                especially because the spelling and ornamentation of some printed books is often neglected.&rdquo;
                (Chenoweth, 2019). Such a statement today would be utterly absurd and history is quite littered with
                these examples.

            <h4>The Issues of Trust</h4>
            <Quote
                quote="The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work."
                author="Satoshi Nakamoto"
            />
            <p>
                Over five-hundred years ago, Fra Luca Bartolomeo de Pacioli published the famous book, &ldquo;Summa de
                arithmetica&rdquo; with the help of the printing press. This book was known for describing the
                principles of double-entry bookkeeping&mdash;principles which are largely unchanged to this day. This
                earned Pacioli the moniker of &ldquo;The Father of Accounting and Bookkeeping.&rdquo; Unfortunately, a
                problem with this system was that it required trust in the bookkeeper. Even in modern times, this
                failure of trust has been felt in examples such as Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, Freddie Mac, AIG,
                Lehman Brothers, Bernie Madoff, and many others. Yet, instances of fraud can be seen throughout all
                of history with the first record of fraud occurring in 300 B.C. when a Greek merchant attempted to
                commit insurance fraud but instead drowned when he was caught in the act (Beattie, 2019).
            </p>
            <p>
                However, fraud has not subsided over time but instead, has accelerated to numbers that are
                incomprehensible. According to Crowe Global, a network of separate and independent accounting and
                consulting firms, &ldquo;fraud losses equate to a shocking US$5.127 trillion each year, which represents
                almost 70% of the $7.442 trillion which world spends on healthcare each year&rdquo; (Crowe Global,
                2019). Moreover, if this were not troubling enough, one of the major enablers of this systematic problem
                is the same group expected to ensure it does not occur: banks.

                In 2020 while the world was being ravaged by the Coronavirus, the International Consortium of
                Investigative Journalists, the same group famously known for the Panama Papers, released a damning
                report on the international banking system. The report concluded that &ldquo;more than $2 trillion in
                transactions between 1999 and 2017 that were flagged by financial institutions’ internal compliance
                officers&rdquo; with that number considered &ldquo;just a drop in a far larger flood of dirty money
                gushing through banks around the world&rdquo; (ICIJ, 2020). This same report is now a Pulitzer Prize
                finalist (Hudson, 2021). However, this should not come as a shock as big banks were largely responsible
                for the 2008 sub-prime mortgage crisis which thrust the world into a global recession. The same crisis
                which led to statements like banks being &ldquo;too big to fail&rdquo; but in reality, banks that are
                too big to fail are too big to exist. Despite their central role in the disaster, their punishment was
                to receive billions of dollars in emergency bailout money while average Americans lost their homes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The scandals from large banks never end with latest (as of this writing) being the anti-trust lawsuit
                filed by the New Mexico State Investment Council &ldquo;claiming Bank of America Corporation,
                Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and other top financial institutions rigged the credit
                default swap market by manipulating a key benchmark&rdquo; (Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, 221).
                Prior to that, there was Wells Fargo&apos;s fake account scandal which the bank opened fraudulent
                accounts for millions of customers without their knowledge (Flitter, 2020). There was also
                JP Morgan&apos;s manipulation of precious-metals and treasury markets which resulted in a Racketeer
                Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) case with multiple individuals indicted and a near billion
                dollar fine (The Economist, 2020). U.S. Banks are not the only bad actors either with investigations
                into Australia&apos;s biggest banks having &ldquo;revealed rampant wrongdoing across the industry,
                including fees charged to the accounts of dead people and bribes paid to win mortgage business&rdquo;
                (Schroeder, 2019). This was all just in the last few years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, there is the best one of them all, the bank for which I could devote an entire article to
                its scandals, questionable dealings, and storied history: Deutsche Bank. From helping pillage the
                Jewish people on behalf of the Nazis and lending the money to build Auschwitz (Perryer, 2019) to
                laundering over a trillion dollars of dirty money including to the Russian mafia and terrorists
                (ICIJ, 2020) the bank has a rap sheet as long as it gets. However, after the ICIJ report the bank
                stated &ldquo;We are a different bank now&rdquo; as a response. Have they changed? Of course not, as
                recently the bank has been caught misleading investor about ESG standards (Kowsmann &amp; Brown, 2021),
                continuing to fail to address money laundering controls (Kowsmann &amp; Strasburg, 2021), continuing
                to be embroiled in multiple scandals due to engaging in shady practices such as mis-selling foreign
                exchange derivatives in Spain and &ldquo;turning a blind eye to a years-long Ponzi scheme that
                involved fraudulent investments in Florida&rdquo; (Arons, 2021), and of course, paying millions in
                fines for having &ldquo;engaged in a criminal scheme to conceal payments to so-called consultants
                worldwide who served as conduits for bribes to foreign officials and others so that they could unfairly
                obtain and retain lucrative business projects&rdquo; (U.S. DOJ, 2021). Frankly, with the number of
                scandals, mind-boggling amount of dirty money, and the amount of money paid to eventual and former
                government leaders from Wall Street companies and big banks, banks will continue to operate as what
                can only be described as a global syndicate and criminal cartel.

            <p>
                The phrase &ldquo;blockchain&rdquo; has been used a number of times to explain how cryptocurrencies
                operate however, the word &ldquo;blockchain&rdquo; is a bit of a misnomer itself. The true innovation
                is the consensus derived decentralized ledger technology (DLT). Not all cryptocurrencies
                utilize blockchains and cryptocurrencies are not the only applications for DLT.

            <h4>Cryptocurrencies</h4>
            <Quote quote="Anyone could create money; the problem is to get it accepted." author="Hyman Minsky" />
            <p>
                One of the most subtle differences that is lost on many individuals in regards to cryptocurrencies is
                that with traditional payment methods, what is actually occurring is the <i>communication</i> of the
                transfer of value. With cryptocurrencies, what you have is the <i>actual transfer of value</i>. This
                goes back to the history of the internet and the original dilemma of the ability to transfer value over
                the internet.
            </p>
            <p>TODO</p>
            <p>
                Moreover, Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics winner, Friedrich August von Hayek has stated that &ldquo;I
                am more convinced than ever that if we ever again are going to have a decent money, it will not come
                from government: it will be issued by private enterprise, because providing the public with good money
                which it can trust and use can not only be an extremely profitable business; it imposes on the issuer a
                discipline to which the government has never been and cannot be subject&rdquo; (Hayek 1999). This was a
                point he later reiterated by saying &ldquo;I don&apos;t believe we shall ever have a good money again
                before we take the thing out of the hands of government, that is, we can’t take them violently out of
                the hands of government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something they can’t
                stop.&rdquo; (Smith, 2019). If this does not sound like cryptocurrencies, I am not sure what Hayek
                could possibly have been referring to.
            </p>
            <h4>Tomorrow&apos;s Fools</h4>
            <Quote
                quote="There is no evidence that we are getting a great technology&mdash;unless 'great technology' doesn't mean 'useful.'"
                author="Nassim Taleb"
            />
            <p>
                Thus, we come to the so-called experts of today and their very loud criticisms toward distributed
                ledger technology (DLT) and cryptocurrencies.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the end, this noise will subside and those dismissing the validity, value, or applications of
                decentralized ledger technology will be forgotten in the dustbin of history. Afterall, we no longer
                listen to the words of those that stated the internet was not going to be important, that Amazon is a
                ponzi scheme, or that the automobile would have little impact on our societies.
            </p>
            <h4>The Status Quo</h4>
            <p>
                Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell and Secretary of the Treasury, Janet Yellen have been the most
                outspoken critics of cryptocurrency from within the U.S. government. Despite their positions, they too
                are relics of a bygone era that are totally out-of-touch with reality. Jerome Powell&apos;s remark that
                &ldquo;You wouldn&apos;t need stablecoins; you wouldn&apos;t need cryptocurrencies, if you had a
                digital U.S. currency&rdquo; is particularly absurd seeing as if that statement were to hold true,
                then we equally would not have a need for commodities such as gold or any currency other than the
                dollar worldwide. Furthermore his statement that &ldquo;We have a tradition in this country where
                the public&apos;s money is held in what is supposed to be a very safe asset&rdquo; is equally invalid
                seeing as that this supposed safe asset is losing its purchasing power each year with wages unable to
                keep up with the very inflation they are creating.
            </p>

            </Figure>
            <p>
                Additionally, as the U.S. dollar global reserve drops to &ldquo;its lowest level in 25 years&rdquo;
                with some analysts saying that &ldquo;this partly reflects the declining role of the US dollar in the
                global economy, in the face of competition from other currencies used by central banks for international
                transactions&rdquo; (Arslanalp &amp; Simpson-Bell, 2021); with some nations like Russia shedding the
                U.S. dollar from their National Wealth Fund (Korsunskaya &amp; Marrow, 2021); and with the
                European Union looking to &ldquo;cut reliance on U.S. dollar&rdquo; (Strupczewski, 2021), the so-called
                &ldquo;safe-asset&rdquo; is losing its grip on the world. This is clearly not a trend limited to our
                rival nations who state &ldquo;We need to move away from using international payment systems controlled
                by the West&rdquo; (Tétrault-Farber &amp; Osborn, 2021) but also friendlier nations that are
                hypercritical of the phenomenon known as the &ldquo;weaponization&rdquo; of the dollar and the SWIFT
                banking network. There is only so long that a nation can abuse its status as the world reserve currency
                before other nations decide to move on to something else. In the case of Russia, China, El Salvador,
                The EU, and many others, they are very well already on their way.

                Moreover, Janet Yellen&apos;s statements where she stated &ldquo;I think many [cryptocurrencies] are
                used, at least in a transaction sense, mainly for illicit financing&rdquo; (Lennon, 2021) when
                questioned about the technology&apos;s potential terrorism risk. Yet, the cryptocurrency market in
                its totality as of this writing sits at around $1.978 trillion which is less that the amount reported
                in the FinCen files. Furthermore, her responses were hyperbole seeing as Lennon goes on to state that
                in &ldquo;2020, the criminal share of all cryptocurrency activity fell to just 0.34% ($10.0 billion in
                transaction volume).&rdquo; What this sounds like is simply an echo from the McCarthy era. Except,
                today&apos;s word is &ldquo;terrorism&rdquo; and quite frankly, if terrorist financing is of actual
                concern to our governmental officials then they should not be looking at cryptocurrency, but rather
                the traditional banking system.

                This is a particularly concerning trend especially due to the nature of Janet Yellen&apos;s sources
                of income. Between 2019 and 2020, Yellen collected a whopping $7.26 million from several speeches
                she had delivered during various engagements. While the former Fed Chair, now Secretary of the
                Treasury was not employed by the US government at the time that money was received, the fact that
                a majority of her clients were Wall Street banks and large corporations outlines an alarming trend
                of corporate influence over those claiming to represent our best interests. This is not unlike Jay
                Clayton who spent his career &ldquo;protecting some of the biggest names on Wall Street&rdquo; and
                also made $7 million from Wallstreet&apos;s elite the year prior to appointment as the chair of
                the very agency that is supposed to keep Wallstreet in check: The Securities and Exchange Commission
                (Merle, 2017).
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, Clayton&apos;s ethics conflicts requiring him to recuse himself from cases involving
                former clients and employers made him virtually ineffective for enforcement actions against the
                majority of Wall Street actors.

                The Pew Research Center shows that the &ldquo;share of American adults who live in middle-income
                households has decreased from 61% in 1971 to 51% in 2019&rdquo; and that from &ldquo;1970 to 2018, the
                share of aggregate income going to middle-class households fell from 62% to 43%. Over the same period,
                the share held by upper-income households increased from 29% to 48%&rdquo; (Pew Research Center, 2020).

                However, despite this, what is most absurd is the hubris of our leaders for believing that a small group
                of politically appointed bureaucrats has the ability to exercise control over something as complex as
                a first world economy. An examination of the results through history shows that not only are they unable
                to meet goals, they are also unable to remain independent&mdash;a critical aspect of being a central bank.

                Aside from the growing wealth disparities in the first world, there are those that have never had
                access to the financial system in any capacity. Despite the trillions of dollars in suspect
                transactions, assets, and revenues by banks &ldquo;too big to fail,&rdquo; nearly 2 billion people
                in the world remain unbanked or underbanked. The sad truth is that they are in this state not because
                it is not possible to provide financial inclusion for these people, it is simply not profitable to
                do so. In fact, in nations such as Ghana and Uganda, cellular airtime minutes are used as money as
                &ldquo;airtime&apos;s value does not rely directly on a government&apos;s stability or ability to
                hold down inflation&rdquo; (The Economist, 2013). Despite still requiring telecom companies as an
                intermediary, this example shows that instruments other than central bank issued currencies can be
                used as mediums of exchange, stores of value, and units of account without the need of banks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another important scenario is the complete failure of governments. This is something that occurs
                far more often than many realize. There are two recent examples of this in 2021 alone. The first was
                in Myanmar when the country&apos;s military staged a coup d&apos;état earlier in the year after
                alleging&mdash;without evidence&mdash;that the election was the result of voter fraud. Despite the
                National League for Democracy (NLD) winning the election with an overwhelming majority and the
                nation&apos;s election commission rejecting the military&apos;s claims, the Tatmadaw seized power
                in the country, arresting elected officials and throwing the national into chaos (Maizland, 2021).
            </p>
            <p>
                The second example is the takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban following the withdrawal of
                U.S. Forces from the region.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus, cryptocurrencies can have a major impact on the unbanked and underbanked providing financial
                inclusion that banks unable to or simply unwilling to provide.

                The only constant in life is change and that is something we as a civilization struggle to accept. As
                we enter this brave new world, it is important to realize that humanity is at a precipice. Whether the
                next level on the Kardashev scale, a grand stage, or simply a new chapter in our story, we are
                entering an exciting era. From quantum computing, fusion energy, decentralized computing, and space
                exploration, it is hard to not think that our story is just beginning. However, there are grave issues
                such as climate change and war which threaten the very existence of our species. It is up to us,
                the people, to ensure that we have a future&mdash;no one will do it for us.
