                The internet is arguably one of the most important innovations in our modern times. I remember the
                internet&apos;s &ldquo;Netscape moment&rdquo; though I was only a child at the time. As an engineer
                and technologist, I would have been ecstatic to live through the Netscape moment with what I know
                today. However, as we know&mdash;at least, for now&mdash;we cannot go back in time. Although, history
                has an interesting habit of rhyming and we may very well be experiencing the next technological
                breakthrough of our time which can once again redefine the way we interact in our societies.
            </p>
            <p>
                What many do not realize today is that the internet was met with a surprising amount of skepticism
                and at one point considered a &ldquo;passing fad&rdquo; by newspaper outlets like the Daily Mail.
                Quite frankly, it is easy to forget such things&mdash;when was the last time you questioned the
                importance of electricity? However, not unlike others throughout history who felt threatened by
                innovative technologies, the Daily Mail made statements that today would be considered absurd. One
                may even argue that today&apos;s experts may be tomorrow&apos;s fools and to support that point, we
                need only to look back in history.

                The Daily Mail also was not the only critic of the internet. Even prominent computer scientists like
                Clifford Stoll were unable to see the internet&apos;s potential. In 1995, Stoll wrote a piece in
                Newsweek that aged quite poorly and today sounds like nothing more than an old man yelling at
                children to get off of his lawn. He stated &ldquo;Visionaries see a future of telecommuting workers,
                interactive libraries and multimedia classrooms. They speak of electronic town meetings and
                virtual communities. Commerce and business will shift from offices and malls to networks and modems.
                And the freedom of digital networks will make government more democratic. Baloney. Do our computer
                pundits lack all common sense? The truth in no online database will replace your daily newspaper,
                no CD-ROM can take the place of a competent teacher and no computer network will change the way
                government works&rdquo; (Stoll, 1995). The irony is that essentially everything Stoll said would
                not come to pass did happen and more. The man literally says &ldquo;Bah&rdquo; to the prospect of
                computer-aided education&mdash;something not only common practice today but essentially mandatory
                if you are to survive in the modern age.

            <p>
                While the internet is the obvious example, the further back in time we go, the more ridiculous the
                statements begin to sound. Thus, the first stop we will arrive at is the original iPhone. Some of us
                may be aware of Steve Balmer&apos;s now famous criticisms of the device for which he stated &ldquo;I
                said that is the most expensive phone in the world and it doesn&apos;t appeal to business customers
                because it doesn&apos;t have a keyboard which makes it not a very good email machine.&rdquo; Although
                that was not the only criticism as others like Matthew Lynn declared that the &ldquo;iPhone is nothing
                more than a luxury bauble that will appeal to a few gadget freaks&rdquo; or &ldquo;John Dvorak&apos;s
                predication that there was &ldquo;no likelihood&rdquo; Apple could succeed in the phone business&rdquo;
                (Weissmann, 2012). Today, the iPhone is arguably the most successful electronic device ever conceived.
            </p>
            <p>
                While a keyboard-less smartphone may be more understandable in recent times, one example that I always
                like to fall back on was the original skepticism that the first automobiles faced in America. Alexander
                Winton, a pioneer of the automotive industry was once told that &ldquo;You&apos;re crazy if you think
                this fool contraption you&apos;ve been wasting your time on will ever displace the horse.&rdquo;
                However, what was most amazing was that the horseless carriage was &ldquo;such an amazing production
                that no one believed it&rdquo; (Winton, 2017). It was this disbelief and utter lack of imagination to
                the possibilities for the technology that left so-called experts making statements which never aged
                well. Although, true futurists such as Thomas Edison saw the potential stating &ldquo;Talking of
                horseless carriage suggests to my mind that the horse is doomed. The bicycle, which, 10 years ago, was
                a curiosity, is now a necessity. It is found everywhere. Ten years from now you will be able to buy a
                horseless vehicle for what you would pay today for a wagon and a pair of horses. The money spent in
                the keep of the horses will be saved and the danger to life will be much reduced.&rdquo; (Winton, 2017).

            <p>
                Which brings us to our final stop in history: the printing press. The printing press is arguably the
                most important technological innovation in human history. It was here that information society took its
                first steps toward the decentralization of information starting with the authority built up around the
                Roman Catholic Church. The printing press was a splash that caused ripples throughout society leading
                to entirely new fields of study that could be written down and shared in a fungible manner. Despite
                this, the experts of the day had a different and exceedingly laughable interpretation at the time.
                One example is Johannes Trithemius, a well-known German scribe known for writing the book
                &ldquo;Steganographia,&rdquo; a book on steganography written in 1499 who wrote &ldquo;Printed books
                will never equal scribed books, especially because the spelling and ornamentation of some printed books
                is often neglected.&rdquo; (Chenoweth, 2019). Such a statement is utterly absurd and history is quite
                littered with these examples as the same narrow-minded and short sighted statements are still made by
                so-called experts today about emerging technologies.

                The phrase &ldquo;blockchain&rdquo; has been used a number of times to explain how cryptocurrencies
                operate however, the word &ldquo;blockchain&rdquo; is a bit of a misnomer itself. Some networks like
                Hedera Hashgraph utilize a directed acyclic graph instead of a blockchain. A blockchain in its
                most simple form is just a sequential database. While Bitcoin is credited as the first
                blockchain, there was one that predated it and has been published in the New York Times since 1995
                (Oberhaus, 2018)&mdash;a fitting harbinger of the technology given 1995 was the Internet&apos;s
                Netscape moment. The true innovation is the consensus derived distributed ledger technology (DLT).
                Not all cryptocurrencies utilize blockchain and cryptocurrencies are not the only applications for
                DLT. Instead, cryptocurrency is the first successful proof-of-concept for DLT with applications in
                every possible field.

            <p>
                How exactly does a <i>simple</i> blockchain-powered DLT network work? While this has been explained
                many times so far, I personally have never been satisfied with the explanations. A DLT network
                is comprised of three main components: the database (a blockchain or other method), a network,
                and the application. The image above is a blockchain in its simplest form. A blockchain is an ordered,
                and incremental database with each block (or state) having a sequential block number that contains an
                index, a timestamp, the one-way cryptographic hash of the block before it, and any data. The
                cryptographic hash is a string of characters which will always be the same so long as the data being
                hashed remains constant. If the data changes in any way, the hash will be completely different. So
                what is the deal with Merkle trees? A Merkle Tree allows for quicker, more efficient verification of
                the chain but also as a measure to conserve space, memory, and CPU usage as &ldquo;old blocks can then
                be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree&rdquo; (Nakamoto, 2009). Essentially, the integrity
                of the entire chain can be ensured by verifying the top hash (or Merkle Root) instead of having to
                verify every transaction and every block which would be time consuming. The diagram below demonstrates
                a Merkle Tree and how blocks can be compacted to a top hash by pairs. In the case of an odd number,
                the remainder is copied and paired with itself.

            <p>
                But what of the others? We have heard the phrase &ldquo;decentralized&rdquo; and
                &ldquo;distributed&rdquo; to describe these networks but what do they actually mean? A distributed
                network is one that distributes a task load across multiple interconnected nodes in order to achieve
                a common goal and receives information/instructions from a singular source. As such, these networks
                can very well be governed under a single authority such as a content-driven network (CDN). In a
                decentralized network, each node operates with only the information it has also known as decision
                locality in order to accomplish its goal. This is how networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP,
                etc. work. A rudimentary example of a decentralized network is an polygyne ant colony (or a colony
                with multiple queens). Such colonies are decentralized as each ant operates on local information
                to perform its tasks and each ant may be conducting a different task but if one queen were to die,
                other queens would still continue to govern the colonies. On the other hand, a distributed network
                can be loosely related to a bee hive as the hive has a single queen and the bees work toward
                a singular and common goal. If the queen were to die, the bees will notice the absence of the
                pheromones produced (aka the instructions from the central authority) and if unable to replace the
                queen, the colony will die off as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                The differences lay in their intricacies as all decentralized networks are distributed but not all
                distributed networks are decentralized. So how does a decentralized network operate on a distributed
                ledger? Ah, yes, so this is precisely why I dislike the majority of explanations on the technology
                as this part may be confusing for many people. A DLT can utilize a database such as a blockchain
                and distribute that database across multiple nodes in the the network. As a result, the database is
                now distributed across a network but is not necessarily decentralized as this ledger can be under
                the control of a single authority. TODO
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus, DLT and other blockchain technologies <i>can</i> create immutable records (though current
                implementations are not entirely immutable) of events that cannot be doctored or as Casey and Vigna
                put it, a &ldquo;Truth Machine&rdquo; (Casey &amp; Vigna, 2018). As a result, the applications for
                the technology are immeasurable and it is often mistakenly considered a new asset class for this
                reason. The <i>truth</i> is, it not a new asset class but rather, it can very well be all asset
                classes as all things can be tokenized. Solving the issues of trust can open up an unimaginable amount
                of opportunities as trust is a problem that has existed in our societies since the very beginning.

            <p>
                Over five-hundred years ago, Fra Luca Bartolomeo de Pacioli published the famous book, &ldquo;Summa de
                arithmetica&rdquo; with the help of the printing press. This book was known for describing the
                principles of double-entry bookkeeping&mdash;principles which are largely unchanged to this day. This
                earned Pacioli the moniker of &ldquo;The Father of Accounting and Bookkeeping.&rdquo; Unfortunately, a
                problem with this system was that it required trust in the bookkeeper. Even in modern times, this
                failure of trust has been felt in examples such as Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, Freddie Mac, AIG,
                Lehman Brothers, Bernie Madoff, and many others. Yet, instances of fraud can be seen throughout all
                of history with the first record of fraud occurring in 300 B.C. when a Greek merchant attempted to
                commit insurance fraud but instead drowned when he was caught in the act (Beattie, 2019).
            </p>
            <p>
                However, fraud has not subsided over time but instead, has accelerated to numbers that are
                incomprehensible. According to Crowe Global, a network of separate and independent accounting and
                consulting firms, &ldquo;fraud losses equate to a shocking US$5.127 trillion each year, which
                represents almost 70% of the $7.442 trillion which world spends on healthcare each year&rdquo;
                (Crowe Global, 2019). Moreover, if this were not troubling enough, one of the major enablers of this
                systematic problem is the same group expected to ensure it does not occur: banks.

                In 2020 while the world was being ravaged by the Coronavirus, the International Consortium of
                Investigative Journalists, the same group famously known for the Panama Papers, released a damning
                report on the international banking system. The report concluded that &ldquo;more than $2 trillion in
                transactions between 1999 and 2017 that were flagged by financial institutions&apos; internal compliance
                officers&rdquo; with that number considered &ldquo;just a drop in a far larger flood of dirty money
                gushing through banks around the world&rdquo; (ICIJ, 2020). This same report is now a Pulitzer Prize
                finalist (Hudson, 2021). However, this should not come as a shock as big banks were largely responsible
                for the 2008 sub-prime mortgage crisis which thrust the world into a global recession. The same crisis
                which led to statements like banks being &ldquo;too big to fail&rdquo; but in reality, banks that are
                too big to fail are too big to exist for the simple reason that they have become a single point of
                failure and single points of failure are security risks in any critical infrastructure. Furthermore,
                despite their central role in the disaster, their punishment was to receive billions of dollars in
                emergency bailout money while average Americans lost their homes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The scandals from large banks never end with latest (as of this writing) being the anti-trust lawsuit
                filed by the New Mexico State Investment Council &ldquo;claiming Bank of America Corporation,
                Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and other top financial institutions rigged the credit
                default swap market by manipulating a key benchmark&rdquo; (Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, 2021).
                Prior to that, there was Wells Fargo&apos;s fake account scandal which the bank opened fraudulent
                accounts for millions of customers without their knowledge (Flitter, 2020). There was also
                JP Morgan&apos;s manipulation of precious-metals and treasury markets which resulted in a Racketeer
                Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) case with multiple individuals indicted and a near billion
                dollar fine (The Economist, 2020). U.S. Banks are not the only bad actors either with investigations
                into Australia&apos;s biggest banks having &ldquo;revealed rampant wrongdoing across the industry,
                including fees charged to the accounts of dead people and bribes paid to win mortgage business&rdquo;
                (Schroeder, 2019). This was all just in the last few years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, there is the best one of them all, the bank for which I could devote an entire article to
                its scandals, questionable dealings, and storied history: Deutsche Bank. From helping pillage the
                Jewish people on behalf of the Nazis and lending the money to build Auschwitz (Perryer, 2019) to
                laundering over a trillion dollars of dirty money including to the Russian mafia and terrorists
                (ICIJ, 2020) the bank has a rap sheet as long as it gets. However, after the ICIJ report the bank
                stated &ldquo;We are a different bank now&rdquo; as a response. Have they changed? Of course not, as
                recently the bank has been caught misleading investor about ESG standards (Kowsmann &amp; Brown, 2021),
                continuing to fail to address money laundering controls (Kowsmann &amp; Strasburg, 2021), continuing
                to be embroiled in multiple scandals due to engaging in shady practices such as mis-selling foreign
                exchange derivatives in Spain and &ldquo;turning a blind eye to a years-long Ponzi scheme that
                involved fraudulent investments in Florida&rdquo; (Arons, 2021), and of course, paying millions in
                fines for having &ldquo;engaged in a criminal scheme to conceal payments to so-called consultants
                worldwide who served as conduits for bribes to foreign officials and others so that they could
                unfairly obtain and retain lucrative business projects&rdquo; (U.S. DOJ, 2021). Frankly, with the
                number of scandals, mind-boggling amount of dirty money, and the amount of money paid to eventual
                and former government leaders from Wall Street companies and big banks, banks will continue to
                operate as what can only be described as a global criminal cartel.

            <Quote quote="Anyone could create money; the problem is to get it accepted." author="Hyman Minsky" />
            <p>
                One of the most subtle differences that is lost on many individuals in regards to cryptocurrencies is
                that with traditional payment methods, what is actually occurring is the <i>communication</i> of the
                transfer of value. With cryptocurrencies, what you have is the <i>actual transfer of value</i>. This
                goes back to the history of the internet and the original dilemma of the ability to transfer value
                over the internet. This problem was eventually tackled head on in 1994 just prior to the
                internet&apos;s Netscape moment by Pizza Hut with the release of &ldquo;PizzaNet.&rdquo; The service
                allowed people to order pizzas online (Schrage, 1994). While there are many stories of  what the
                first actual commercial transaction over the internet was, Pizza Hut gets the widest recognition for
                being one of the first commercial operations online. Unsurprisingly, the approach was still somewhat
                mocked, considered &ldquo;half-baked&rdquo; and geeky at the time, but more importantly, the system
                did not facilitate the transfer of value over the net as payment was made upon delivery.
            </p>
            <p>
                This tradition was continued as history has a tendency to rhyme. On May 22, 2010, an individual used
                bitcoin to pay for pizza in what is widely regarded as the first use of cryptocurrency in a
                commercial transaction (Moore, 2020). Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 bitcoin for his pizzas which at
                today&apos;s value sits at around $483,784,000. However, this begs the question about what the value
                should be of cryptocurrencies. The truth is, they are worth whatever we as a society believe they
                are worth as everything is a speculative asset including land and gold. The only reason gold has
                value is because we deem it so and other mediums such as cowry shells and sticks have also been used
                in the past as money. This comes down the functions of money and the properties that make a medium
                more or less viable as a form of money.
            </p>
            <p>
                Money has three functions: a store of value, a medium of exchange, and a unit of account. This much
                is pretty textbook however, one point I find is often lost is the difference between money and
                currency. The difference is that currency has all the attributes of money except it is <i>not</i> a
                store of value and instead, a promissory note. As such, fiat is a currency and it not money but the
                medium by which money is transferred. This subtle difference emerged for reasons of convenience as
                gold coin was less portable than paper notes. This brings us to the properties of money (and
                currency) of which portability is a major plus. Others include durability, divisibility, supply,
                fungibility (or uniformity), its rate of adoption, and its security (or ability to counterfeit). When
                compared to traditional paper currency, cryptocurrencies have far superior properties. For example,
                you cannot break a bitcoin (although not unlike paper money, it can be lost forever), it can be
                divided to 100 millionths of a bitcoin, there is a finite supply making it deflationary, it is
                perfectly fungible, and it has security features that make forgery virtually impossible.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although not currently widely adopted, its adoption is increasing especially as nations like El
                Salvador adopt the technology as legal currency (Renteria, Wilson, &amp; Strohecker, 2021). Although
                Bitcoin is only one of many and not all cryptocurrencies have fixed supplies. Some like Ethereum
                implement &ldquo;tokenomics&rdquo; which allow new ether to be issued through mining or staking
                and other ether to removed by burning some during each transaction. This can potentially offer
                governments revolutionary new ways of self-organizing macroeconomic policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moreover, Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics winner, Friedrich August von Hayek has stated that &ldquo;I
                am more convinced than ever that if we ever again are going to have a decent money, it will not come
                from government: it will be issued by private enterprise, because providing the public with good money
                which it can trust and use can not only be an extremely profitable business; it imposes on the issuer a
                discipline to which the government has never been and cannot be subject&rdquo; (Hayek 1999). This was a
                point he later reiterated by saying &ldquo;I don&apos;t believe we shall ever have a good money again
                before we take the thing out of the hands of government, that is, we can&apos;t take them violently out
                of the hands of government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something they
                can&apos;t stop.&rdquo; (Smith, 2019). If this does not sound like cryptocurrencies, I am not sure what
                Hayek could possibly have been referring to.

            <p>
                However, on the other hand, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell and Secretary of the Treasury,
                Janet Yellen have been the most outspoken critics of cryptocurrency from within the U.S. government.
                Despite their positions, they too are relics of a bygone era that are totally out-of-touch with
                reality. Jerome Powell&apos;s remark that &ldquo;You wouldn&apos;t need stablecoins; you
                wouldn&apos;t need cryptocurrencies, if you had a digital U.S. currency&rdquo; is particularly absurd
                seeing as if that statement were to hold true, then we equally would not have a need for commodities
                such as gold or any currency other than the dollar worldwide. Furthermore his statement that &ldquo;We
                have a tradition in this country where the public&apos;s money is held in what is supposed to be a
                very safe asset&rdquo; is equally invalid seeing as that this supposed safe asset is losing its
                purchasing power each year with wages unable to keep up with the very inflation they are creating.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, as the U.S. dollar global reserve drops to &ldquo;its lowest level in 25 years&rdquo;
                with some analysts saying that &ldquo;this partly reflects the declining role of the US dollar in the
                global economy, in the face of competition from other currencies used by central banks for
                international transactions&rdquo; (Arslanalp &amp; Simpson-Bell, 2021); with some nations like Russia
                shedding the U.S. dollar from their National Wealth Fund (Korsunskaya &amp; Marrow, 2021); and with the
                European Union looking to &ldquo;cut reliance on U.S. dollar&rdquo; (Strupczewski, 2021), the so-called
                &ldquo;safe-asset&rdquo; is losing its grip on the world. This is clearly not a trend limited to our
                rival nations who state &ldquo;We need to move away from using international payment systems controlled
                by the West&rdquo; (Tétrault-Farber &amp; Osborn, 2021) but also friendlier nations that are
                hypercritical of the phenomenon known as the &ldquo;weaponization&rdquo; of the dollar and the SWIFT
                banking network. There is only so long that a nation can abuse its status as the world reserve currency
                before other nations decide to move on to something else. In the case of Russia, China, El Salvador,
                The EU, and many others, they are very well already on their way.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moreover, Janet Yellen&apos;s statements where she stated &ldquo;I think many [cryptocurrencies] are
                used, at least in a transaction sense, mainly for illicit financing&rdquo; (Lennon, 2021) when
                questioned about the technology&apos;s potential terrorism risk. Yet, the cryptocurrency market in
                its totality as of this writing sits at around $1.978 trillion which is less that the amount reported
                in the FinCen files. Furthermore, her responses were hyperbole seeing as Lennon goes on to state that
                in &ldquo;2020, the criminal share of all cryptocurrency activity fell to just 0.34% ($10.0 billion in
                transaction volume).&rdquo; What this sounds like is simply an echo from the McCarthy era. Except,
                today&apos;s word is &ldquo;terrorism&rdquo; and quite frankly, if terrorism financing is of actual
                concern to our governmental officials then they should not be looking at cryptocurrency, but rather
                the traditional banking system. This is especially pressing as a &ldquo;new lawsuit says the banks,
                including Deutsche Bank and Standard Chartered, ignored warnings that their customers were helping
                to finance attackers targeting Americans in Afghanistan&rdquo; (Flitter, 2021).

                The Pew Research Center shows that the &ldquo;share of American adults who live in middle-income
                households has decreased from 61% in 1971 to 51% in 2019&rdquo; and that from &ldquo;1970 to 2018, the
                share of aggregate income going to middle-class households fell from 62% to 43%. Over the same period,
                the share held by upper-income households increased from 29% to 48%&rdquo; (Pew Research Center, 2020).
                At the end of 2020, the top 1% of households command $34.52T or approximately 32% of the wealth in the
                U.S. as well as more than the 50-90 percentile and bottom 50 percent combined which command
                approximately 29%. This puts the top 1% almost 9 points higher than in 1989 while the entire bottom
                50% sits at almost 10 points lower than in 1989 (The Fed, 2021). Additionally, the median sale price
                of houses in the last three decades has quadrupled putting home ownership for many out of reach
                while dependance on banking institutions for home buying increases.

                Moreover, a Federal Reserve report on U.S. household economic well-being showed that the median
                savings of American households sitting at just $5,300 (The Fed, 2020). Additionally, 24% of surveyed
                would opt to incur some form of revolving debt if faced with a $400 emergency expense. An additional
                12% stated that they would not be able to pay for the expense as well as another 8% stating they would
                sell something. The situation shows the vulnerability of such households as &ldquo;volatile income and
                low savings can turn common experiences&mdash;such as waiting a few days for a bank deposit to be
                available&mdash;into a problem for some&rdquo; (The Fed, 2019).

                Aside from the growing wealth disparities in the first world, there are those that have never had
                access to the financial system in any capacity. Despite the trillions of dollars in suspect
                transactions, assets, and revenues by banks &ldquo;too big to fail,&rdquo; nearly 2 billion people
                in the world remain unbanked or underbanked. The sad truth is that they are in this state not because
                it is not possible to provide financial inclusion for these people, it is simply not profitable to
                do so. In fact, in nations such as Ghana and Uganda, cellular airtime minutes are used as money as
                &ldquo;airtime&apos;s value does not rely directly on a government&apos;s stability or ability to
                hold down inflation&rdquo; (The Economist, 2013). Despite still requiring telecom companies as an
                intermediary, this example shows that modern instruments other than central bank issued currencies
                can be used as mediums of exchange, stores of value, and units of account without the need of banks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another important scenario is the complete failure of governments. This is something that occurs
                far more often than many realize. There are two recent examples of this in 2021 alone. The first was
                in Myanmar when the country&apos;s military staged a coup d&apos;état earlier in the year after
                alleging&mdash;without evidence&mdash;that the election was the result of voter fraud. Despite the
                National League for Democracy (NLD) winning the election with an overwhelming majority and the
                nation&apos;s election commission rejecting the military&apos;s claims, the Tatmadaw seized power
                in the country, arresting elected officials and throwing the national into chaos (Maizland, 2021).
            </p>
            <p>
                The second example is the takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban following the withdrawal of
                U.S. Forces from the region. The nation&apos;s financial infrastructure all but collapsed with
                bank runs, cash shortages, and a failing currency making an already devastating situation worse
                for millions of Afghanis. One individual stated &ldquo;I live above two banks and three ATM machines,
                but they&apos;ve been off since Thursday&rdquo;. Moreover, &rdquo;Western Union has suspended all
                services and even the centuries-old &rdquo;hawala&ldquo; system &mdash; which facilitates
                cross-border transactions via a sophisticated network of money exchangers and personal contacts
                &mdash; for now, remains closed&ldquo; (Sigalos, 2021) effectively cutting the people off from
                the global financial system.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, what is most impressive is that people outside of finance and banking can really make a
                difference in the world which exemplifies the very nature of decentralization. A case and point:
                Akon&apos;s Akoin. Akon is working to provide the very financial inclusion banks could care less to
                provide to people in African nations. The artist even incorporates some of the critical intricacies
                with value transfer in the region by tokenizing cellular minutes which are already being used as a
                form of money as mentioned above in places like Kenya. His message is one that is heard and felt
                all too often in such areas, that the current systems offer nothing more than &ldquo;weak and
                over-inflated fiat currencies that prevent citizens from accessing financial services western
                countries take for granted&rdquo; (Stevens, 2021). Akon&apos;s point is well made as when the U.S.
                dollar experiences inflation, second and third world nations hurt the most. It is this simple
                correlation that exposes the myth of inflation being a positive thing&mdash;inflation only benefits
                the wealthy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus, cryptocurrencies can have a major impact on the unbanked and underbanked providing financial
                inclusion that banks unable to or simply unwilling to provide. Moreover, DLT has several applications
                in these scenarios from facilitating payments, identity, and even voting. While voting systems
                using DLT are not ready for mainstream application, the technology can offer a way to virtually
                eliminate cases of voter fraud, prevent gerrymandering, and encourage more people to vote through
                an increased level of convenience. Even in countries like the United States, allegation of voter
                fraud have drawn disconcerting parallels with events in less democratic nations such as Myanmar. The
                allegations alone have had a damaging effect on reputations, undermined trust in democratic processes,
                and continues to divide an already divided nation.

                As the possibilities of DLT are endless, societies can begin to restore their faith in systems that
                have failed them for generations. The road ahead is not going to be easy with much of the DLT space
                today not unlike the wild west as are all new frontiers. However, as adoption increases and new
                networks arise, a world completely powered by DLT will be unrecognizable from today.
            </p>
            <p>
                While not many people think about some of the more insignificant minutia of our day-to-day, there
                are several things that are done today simply because that is how they always have been done. For
                example, payday can occur weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly, monthly, or by any other arbitrary
                denomination. It is not something we often think of, it just it. However, what if money could
                be thought of in an entirely different way? Perhaps money could become more akin to bandwidth with
                payroll done every second. This approach could give individuals far more control of their finances
                with the ability to fine tune savings, bills, and even retirement in real-time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus, credit applications could do away with credit scores and simply determine an individual&apos;s
                average available bandwidth over a predetermined period of time. This could also change the way bills
                are paid by delegating bandwidth toward bills which automatically adjust interest rates within a
                predetermined range accepted by both parties and enforced via smart contracts. The same can apply to
                savings and retirement accounts allowing individuals to simply dial-up or dial down their various
                account streams based on their inbound and outbound streams. Account pools can allow individuals
                to predetermine their future finances whether for retirement or simply knowing exactly how long until
                a pool will run out at its current rates.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, money is not the only application for DLT technology. Anything from movie tickets, licenses,
                academic degrees, certifications credentials, warranties, certificates of authenticity, and artwork
                can be a non-fungible or semi-fungible token (NFT/SFT). Businesses can leverage promotions that
                can span many years with loyal customers never missing out. For example, a movie theater can offer
                discounts for multi-part movies that hold the ticket NFT for previous installments. Collectibles can
                be issued for those that visited a theater for a movie and special editions can be minted for those
                that saw an entire trilogy in theaters. This could conceivably extend to products where individuals
                that own an obsolete version of a product can receive a special promotional price for upgrading. Of
                course, commerce is not the only aspect but property deeds, automotive titles, lease and mortgage
                agreements, and more can all be tokenized in an internet of value.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even industries like healthcare can greatly benefit from DLT and the democratization of healthcare
                data. Interoperable healthcare networks powered using DLT can offer a single source of truth
                for a patient&apos;s healthcare data. This not only eliminates issues of patient misidentification
                and incomplete records, it allows for near-perfect data liquidity. Healthcare bills, prescriptions,
                and insurance can be minted as NFTs which ensure bills, prescriptions, referrals, etc. are not lost,
                not able to be forged, and not double-spent greatly reducing healthcare administrative costs. Data
                breaches would also not expose millions of patient records at a time. Furthermore, with improved
                data liquidity and real-time de-identification of data, organizations like the CDC and WHO can
                receive streams of population health data in real-time allowing these critical organizations to
                monitor possible outbreaks before they become epidemic. Perhaps, it may even be possible to pinpoint
                sources of outbreaks by cross-referencing regions of increased reports of say, salmonella, with
                agricultural supply chain data automatically.
            </p>
            <p>
                With governmental adoption, W2s and other tax forms can be minted by addresses with EIN NFTs which
                could trigger the income stream to an employee address. However, this could conceivably open
                multiple streams of value at once: one to an employee, and the second directly to the IRS for
                taxes virtually eliminating tax evasion. Census data can be collected more easily and accurately
                and maintained with minimal effort especially when government networks interoperate with one
                another. Eventually, voting can be done using DLT which would not only eliminate any possible fraud,
                but more importantly, the legitimacy of an election cannot be questioned.

                Additionally, no more will exist the days of guessing wildly at how to control something as complex
                as a first-world economy. Instead of massive injections of cash, or removing massive amounts of
                cash from circulation using slow and antiquated methods of buying and selling bonds, self-organizing
                systems can make nano-scale changes to macroeconomic variables and automatically adjust factors
                to maintain and achieve key economic targets. These economies are as complex and interconnected as
                living entities and as such, should be treated that way using self-organizing system principles. Not
                only can this approach help ensure more stable economies but the instantaneous feedback loops can
                allow governments to create more accurate future projections for economic growth. We can once again
                have sound money issued by central banks.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the nature of self-organizing systems which enable our societies to have some measure of
                control in order to predetermine the consequences of our actions. Our societies have been traveling
                a path of decentralization for quite some time. From Martin Luther&apos;s 95 Theses and the printing
                press, to the Civil Rights movement and broadcast media, until now, a technological, financial,
                economic, social, and artistic revolution&mdash;a modern renaissance&mdash;with distributed ledger
                technology. We have been breaking down centralized nexuses of power and empowering more individual
                people over time and with DLT, we are approaching a technological singularity point. The future
                described above may sound far-fetched today, but as we begin to move into a world where issues of
                trust become a thing of the past, anything is possible.

                The only constant in life is change and that is something we as a civilization struggle to accept. As
                we enter this brave new world, it is important to realize that humanity is at a precipice. Whether the
                next level on the Kardashev scale, a grand stage, or simply a new chapter in our story, we are
                entering an exciting era. From quantum computing, fusion energy, decentralized networks, artificial
                intelligence, and space exploration, it is hard to not think that our story is just beginning.
                However, there are grave issues such as climate change and war which threaten the very existence of
                our species. It is up to us, the people, to ensure that we have a future and demand that our leaders
                protect and nurture that future.

                For me, Jack Dorsey&apos;s statement where he hopes the technology &ldquo;creates world peace or
                helps create world peace&rdquo; is far more accurate than many today realize. Dorsey goes on to
                say that &ldquo;It may sound a bit ridiculous but you fix that foundational level and everything
                above it improves. It is in the long-term but my hope is definitely peace&rdquo; (Salvo, 2021).
                DLT <i>is</i> a foundational technology that may very well solve one of the most difficult problems
                in our societies: trust. Large, centralized organizations can no longer act as the gatekeepers to
                society&apos;s interests. Financial fraud will enter the halls of extinction and so too may the
                large monolithic organization. Instead of trust in money, we would have belief in ideas and thus,
                such ideas created by anyone. That is the future of DLT and consequently, the future of human society.
