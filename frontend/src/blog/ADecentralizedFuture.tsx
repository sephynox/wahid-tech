                The internet is arguably the most important innovation in our modern times. I remember the
                internet&apos;s &ldquo;Netscape moment&rdquo; though I was only a child at the time. As an engineer and
                technologist, I would have been ecstatic to live through the Netscape moment with what I know today.
                However, as we know--at least, for now--we cannot go back in time. Although, history has an interesting
                habit of rhyming and we may very well be experiencing the next technological breakthrough of our time.

                What many forget is that the internet was met with a surprising amount of skepticism and at one point
                considered a &ldquo;passing fad&rdquo; by newspaper outlets like the Daily Mail. However, not unlike
                others throughout history who felt threatened by innovative technologies, the Daily Mail made statements
                that today would be considered absurd. One may even argue that today&apos;s experts may be
                tomorrow&apos;s fools and to support that point, we can take a look back in history.

                quote="iPhone is nothing more than a luxury bauble that will appeal to a few gadget freaks."
                author="Matthew Lynn"
            />
            <p>
                We will start with something more familiar as the further back in time we go, the more ridiculous the
                statements begin to sound. Thus, the first stop we will arrive at is the original iPhone. Some of us may
                be aware of Steve Balme&apos;s now famous criticisms of the device in which he stated &ldquo;I said that
                is the most expensive phone in the world and it doesn&apos;t appeal to business customers because it
                doesn&apos;t have a keyboard which makes it not a very good email machine.&rdquo; Although that was not
                the only criticism as others like Matthew Lynn declared that the &ldquo;iPhone is nothing more than a
                luxury bauble that will appeal to a few gadget freaks&rdquo; or &ldquo;John Dvorak&apos;s predication
                that there was &ldquo;no likelihood&rdquo; Apple could succeed in the phone business&rdquo; (Weissmann,
                2012). Today, the iPhone is arguably the most successful electronic device ever conceived.
            </p>
            <p>
                While a keyboard-less smartphone may be more understandable in recent times, one that I always like to
                fall back on was the original skepticism that the first automobiles faced in America. Alexander Winton,
                a pioneer of the automotive industry was once told that &ldquo;You&apos;re crazy if you think this fool
                contraption you’ve been wasting your time on will ever displace the horse.&rdquo; However, what was most
                amazing was that the horseless carriage was &ldquo;such an amazing production that no one believed
                it&rdquo; (Winton, 2017). It was this disbelief and utter lack of imagination to the possibilities for
                the technology that left so-called experts making statements which never aged well. Although, true
                futurists such as Thomas Edison saw the potential stating &ldquo;Talking of horseless carriage suggests
                to my mind that the horse is doomed. The bicycle, which, 10 years ago, was a curiosity, is now a
                necessity. It is found everywhere. Ten years from now you will be able to buy a horseless vehicle for
                what you would pay today for a wagon and a pair of horses. The money spent in the keep of the horses
                will be saved and the danger to life will be much reduced.&rdquo; (Winton, 2017).

            <Quote
                quote="Printed books will never equal scribed books, especially because the spelling and ornamentation of some printed books is often neglected."
                author="Johannes Trithemius"
            />
            <p>
                Which brings us to our final stop in history: the printing press. The printing press is arguably the
                most important technological innovation in human history. It was here that information society took its
                first steps toward the decentralization of information starting with the authority built up around the
                Roman Catholic Church. The printing press was a splash that caused ripples throughout society leading to
                entirely new fields of study that could be written down and shared in a fungible manner. Despite this,
                the experts of the day had a different and exceedingly laughable interpretation at the time. One example
                is Johannes Trithemius, a well-known German scribe known for writing the book
                &ldquo;Steganographia,&rdquo; a book on steganography written in 1499 who wrote “Printed books will
                never equal scribed books, especially because the spelling and ornamentation of some printed books is
                often neglected.” (Chenoweth, 2019). Such a statement today would be utterly absurd and history is
                littered with these examples.

            <h3>The Issues of Trust</h3>
            <Quote
                quote="The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work."
                author="Satoshi Nakamoto"
            />
            <p>
                Over five-hundred years ago, Fra Luca Bartolomeo de Pacioli published the famous book, &ldquo;Summa de
                arithmetica&rdquo; with the help of the printing press. This book was known for describing the
                principles of double-entry bookkeeping--principles which are largely unchanged to this day. This earned
                Pacioli the moniker of &ldquo;The Father of Accounting and Bookkeeping.&rdquo; Unfortunately, a problem
                with this system was that it required trust in the bookkeeper. Even in modern times, this failure of
                trust has been felt in examples such as Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, Freddie Mac, AIG, Lehman Brothers, Bernie
                Madoff, and many others. Yet, instances of fraud can be seen throughout all of history with the first
                record of fraud occurring in 300 B.C. when a Greek merchant attempted to commit insurance fraud but
                instead drowned when he was caught in the act (Beattie, 2019).
            </p>
            <p>
                However, fraud has not subsided over time but instead, has accelerated to numbers that are
                incomprehensible. According to Crowe Global, a network of separate and independent accounting and
                consulting firms, &ldquo;fraud losses equate to a shocking US$5.127 trillion each year, which represents
                almost 70% of the $7.442 trillion which world spends on healthcare each year&rdquo; (Crowe Global,
                2019).

                that they are in this state not because it is not possible to provide financial inclusion for these
                people, it is simply not profitable to do so.

            <Quote quote="Anyone could create money; the problem is to get it accepted." author="Hyman Minsky" />
            <p>
                One of the most subtle differences that is lost on many individuals in regards to cryptocurrencies is
                that with traditional payment methods, what is actually occurring is the <i>communication</i> of the
                transfer of value. With cryptocurrencies, what you have is the <i>actual transfer of value</i>. This
                goes back to the history of the internet and the original dilemma of the ability to transfer value over
                the internet.
            </p>
            <p>TODO</p>
            <p>
                Moreover, Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics winner, Friedrich August von Hayek has stated that &ldquo;I
                am more convinced than ever that if we ever again are going to have a decent money, it will not come
                from government: it will be issued by private enterprise, because providing the public with good money
                which it can trust and use can not only be an extremely profitable business; it imposes on the issuer a
                discipline to which the government has never been and cannot be subject&rdquo; (Hayek 1999). This was a
                point he later reiterated by saying &ldquo;I don&apos;t believe we shall ever have a good money again
                before we take the thing out of the hands of government, that is, we can’t take them violently out of
                the hands of government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something they can’t
                stop.&rdquo; (Smith, 2019). If this does not sound like cryptocurrencies, I am not sure what Hayek could
                possibly have been referring to.

            <p>
                Thus, we come to the so-called experts of today and their very loud criticisms toward distributed ledger
                technology (DLT) and cryptocurrencies.
