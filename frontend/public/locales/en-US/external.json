    "bitcoin_description": "Bitcoin is the genesis of cryptocurrency. It was the first peer-to-peer solution which solved the double-spend problem through its Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism. Since then, other consensus mechanisms have risen such as Proof of Stake or XRP's Consensus. The technology is the first to solve a problem that has plagues the internet since inception: the ability to transfer value without the use of an intermediary. While there are some concerns such as the 51% attack and the inability to withstand quantum computing, it is a landmark technological innovation which furthers humanity's journey on its path toward decentralization.",
    "ripple_description": "XRP was developed as an improvement to Bitcoin. Unlike bitcoin which is mined, XRP is all pre-mined with a fixed supply. Additionally, XRP's consensus mechanism is their own: Consensus. As a result, the XRP Ledger utilizes far less energy than both the Bitcoin protocol and the traditional financial system itself."
